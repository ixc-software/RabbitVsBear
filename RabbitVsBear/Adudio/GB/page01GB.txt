There once was a bear who lived in a forest. He was so strong and fierce! As he walked through the forest he ate every living being he met on his way. The forest was large and there were many animals in it, but all of them were afraid of that bear. Indeed, in less than a year, if the bear keeps behaving like this, there will be not a living soul in the forest.
