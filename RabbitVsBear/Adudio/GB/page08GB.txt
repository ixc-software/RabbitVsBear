The day was drawing to a close. The bear was sitting in his lair all day long waiting for the animals to send him someone for dinner. He couldn't wait any longer. Hunger began to bother him and along with it anger began to overcome him. “What is this?” roared the bear. “What are they thinking? Have they forgotten about me? Or do they think a crow will fill me for two days? Oh, cursed beasts! If there is no meal for me from them immediately, then, bless my soul, tomorrow morning I'll go to the forest and strangle every living thing in it! I'll not leave a single tail!”
