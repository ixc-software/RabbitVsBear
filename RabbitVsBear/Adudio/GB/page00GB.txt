We would like to perform for you, an old Ukrainian fairy tale with pictures. The tale is not only illustrated, but also allows your children to change the languages while watching. After changing a language the text also changes and the story is plays in another language. It helps your child to learn foreign languages by intuition and fosters interest in learning foreign languages. Give your child an opportunity to learn seven foreign languages in a playful manner.
