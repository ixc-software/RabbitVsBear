That poor rabbit was so frightened...what was he to do? Others went to the bear, and he had to as well. So he even didn't quarrel. He only asked for an hour to say good-bye to his wife and children. He found his wife, gathered all his family, said his good-byes, they cried and hugged each other, it was already past noon.

It was late, the time had come for the rabbit to set out on his journey.
